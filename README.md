# About Moi
My name is Vivek Shenoy. I am a freshman at SLU studying Computer Science. I have been studying Computer Science for a couple of months now. I am mostly self taught with a little bit of help from my loving **BIOLOGICAL FATHER**. My repo contains mostly my csci_1070 course work. Like my class notes, homework assignments, and quiz answers. Later on I plan on adding my own personal projects.
